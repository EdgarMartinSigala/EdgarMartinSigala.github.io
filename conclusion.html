	    <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
	    <p>In conclusion with all the work I have done and learned in this class, I appreciated it. I learned how to be a better writer and a better team player since most of the work I have done or learned tended to be only by myself.
	    The work that you will see is what I believe was the best work I did my best in the class.
