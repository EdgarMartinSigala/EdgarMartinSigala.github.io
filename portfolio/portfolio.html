			<p>This essay was my first major work that show cased my abilities to rhetorically analyze a piece of visual work.

In this video the artists create their first love song and describe the struggles that a couple faces to make the relationship work. <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DbOCd3BQMEakLNb1YzbIXYSnoNkQJEH8xzffeCT2oWA/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is the essay.</p>

				<img src="images/MM1 (Writing 1E).PNG">
			</a>
			<p>This is one of the small projects that I had to do called multimodal texts. In these small projects I had to create a piece of a work that used
			the aspects that I learned in a book called <i>"The Digital Writer"</i> by Sean Morey. In this work I create a infographic that would give someone the very basic tools into making an ad by the audience use kairos, logos, pathos, and ethos. They should also have a first draft where they could revise a large amount of their imperfections. 
			<a href="files/MM2.zip">Here</a> is the picture and the author's note that went with it which is what went through my mind when I created the work.</p>
			<h1>Multimodal Text 3</h1>

				<img src="images/MMT3 video(Writing 1E).PNG">
			</a>
			<p>In this multimodal text I analyze the movie trailer <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> by the use of the analyzing skills that I learned from the book like the colors seen and the emotions that some people would feel when watching it. I also had difficulty when deciding what should be the work that I would analyze and what platform should 
			I use to express my analysis. I ended up deciding to use this movie since it was still a topic talked about this year and the platform that I used ended up being Adobe Spark. <a href="files/MMT3.zip">Here</a> for the author's note and click the picture for the video.</p>
			<h1>Research Paper</h1>

			</a>
			<p>In this paper I do research on one of the major issues that is talked about between people which is whether the wage gap exists? In this paper I decided to organize it by having an introduction paragrapgh that was able to catch the audiences eye and tell the audience what I was planning to do. After that I did research on both sides talked about each side and see what each side believed in. Then I put my own opinion on what I believed about the matter with the use of the research that I gathered. <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJfsE7lsu48g4uBDhF-ciEqMg4zC7XBIN1IAfGPt2fM/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is the link to the paper.</p>
